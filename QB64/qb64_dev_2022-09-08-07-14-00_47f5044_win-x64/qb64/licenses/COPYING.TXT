=== IMPORTANT LICENSING NOTE FOR QB64 PROGRAMMERS ===
If you are using fonts, you are bound by the terms of FreeType's license. Somewhere in your software package should include a notice that your program includes the FreeType library (see licence_freetype_ftl.txt for details).
Other components are licensed under various permissive licences.
In all cases, you should distribute the licenses folder with your program.

It should be noted that providing source code is not the only way to meet the conditions of the LGPL (eg dynamic linking) but it is by far the easiest from a technical point of view at this current time.
